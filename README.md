A simple convnet example that classifies MNIST figures

- It is an example code for convolutional neural networks, also known as convents, a type of deep learning model used almost universally in computer vision applications.
- convents are the best type of machine learning models for computer vision tasks. it's possible to train one from scratch even on a very small dataset, with decent result.
- convents work by learning a hierarchy of modular patterns and concepts to represent the visual world.
